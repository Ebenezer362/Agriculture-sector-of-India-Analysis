# Agric Sector of India Analysis

# Project Overview

This analysis is aim to help  farmers, people who make rules, and other interested in crop farming to get a full view of how well crop farming is doing across India. It let you dive into details about how many crops are grown, understand the health of the soil, and figure out how changes in the weather can affect farming. Our aim is to provide helpful information that makes it easier to make good choices, support farming that‚Äôs good for the environment and helps to ensure there‚Äôs enough food for everyone while also helping the farming industry to grow.

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Excel**: For data preprocessing, exploration, and transformation.
- **Power BI**: For creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations.

## üìä Visualizations and What They Show

- **Line Chart: Average pH vs. Total Production by Crop Type**  
  Demonstrates how soil pH correlates with crop output across different crop categories.

- **Pie Chart: Total Production by Crop Type**  
  Displays the share of overall agricultural production attributed to Rabi, Kharif, Summer, and Annual crops.

- **Bar Chart: Crop Variety by State**  
  Highlights the number of distinct crops recorded in each Indian state, offering insight into crop diversity.

- **Horizontal Bar Chart: Total Production by State**  
  Compares the total production (in tons) across states, identifying the top and bottom performers.

## üìÅ Data Source

All datasets were retrieved from **Kaggle**, covering:
- Crop types and categories  
- Production volumes in tons  
- State-wise agricultural data  
- Soil pH levels

---

## ‚ùì Key Questions Explored

- How does soil pH affect crop productivity across crop categories?
- What is the proportional contribution of each crop type to the national total?
- Which states are leaders or laggards in crop production?
- How diverse is crop cultivation across various states?
- What strategies can help improve agricultural output?

## üîç Major Insights

- **Soil pH Impact**: Lower pH values are associated with reduced crop productivity.
- **Crop Diversity Leaders**: Uttar Pradesh (12,600 crop records) and Madhya Pradesh (9,300) show high crop variety; Goa has the least (100), influenced by local climate.
- **Production Breakdown**:  
  - **Rabi crops**: 44.2% of total output  
  - **Kharif crops**: 38.81%  
  - **Summer crops**: 2.9% (limited due to heat and water shortages)
- **Top Producing States**:  
  - Uttar Pradesh: 0.70 billion tons  
  - West Bengal: 0.44 billion tons  
- **Lowest**: Chandigarh, with only 63 tons.

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- **Soil Optimization**: Improving soil pH levels can enhance yields in crops that underperform due to acidic or alkaline soil conditions.

- **Crop Suitability Research**: Identifying suitable crops for each state based on soil and climatic conditions can optimize production.

- **Climate-Smart Agriculture**: Encouraging sustainable farming methods and crop diversification can help mitigate regional climatic variations.

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitating collaboration between high- and low-producing states to implement best agricultural practices and maximize output.
